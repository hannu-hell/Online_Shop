# Online_Shop

This is a project which uses different approaches to developing an online platform for a shop using Node.Js where products are diplayed by users and can buy and sell. It uses the MVC architecture and by different approaches I mean the way data is stored. It uses MySQL and NoSQL methods to explore and mainly for self teaching how to implement both types of data storing methods.

Sequel is used with MySQL and MongoDB with NoSQL method.

I hope to create branches to explore these methods so they can be refered when needed.

The main branch will be updated as I progress through the project and the rest of the method will be kept in seperate branches for reference.
